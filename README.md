# Fibonacci
Learning turtle in Python

I really wanted to get more farmiliar with pythons "Turtle graphics". I had been messing with a few lines of code to create the well known fibonacci sequence of numbers and I thought it would be awesome to have them drawn out!

With some help of my friend and classmate Ryan We were able to generate the outputs of the initial function and use them as the inputs for the turtle. 

Always love feedback for changes and improvements, it really helps me learn! Thanks!
